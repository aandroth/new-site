Create a series of opening tabs that allow the user to drill farther down
 - skill keyword -> list of projects -> code for that skill in that project
 - Have tool-tip pages that show a mini-page with a banner for the game and text about it. Clicking on the name or link will take the user to the page, and a Play Now link will be on both

Theme is typed in by visitor, and it uses image generation to style the site
So, type in "pizza" and the site will style everything with the word pizza, so pizza banner
 - Can I do this with Micrososft's image generator?

Redo the resume in the style of the website
 - And have the sections show the tool-tip boxes, like on the main site

Have a roulette wheel of different game projects (Accesses database)

Favorite Projects
 - Game Library
 - Website
 - Game Jams
	 - Father Game // Need to finish
	 - Rocket Ferret // Where is this?
	 - Political Office Sim // Where is this?

Meta and Peeka as proof of good collab skills w/ developer and cross-functional teams

Website thoughts:
 - Crisp, snazzy, minimal
 - Boldly highlight projects
 - Boldly highlight jobs
	 - Say the biggest lesson learned for each role
	 - Most enjoyable part of each

Ideas:
 - Have images in the background of the different blurb boxes that show what tech was used for each project
 - Have each section come up over the previous one, with the titles becoming tabs at the top that the use can click on to go back to really fast
 -- Have the border of the website look like Visual Studio, and have my name and profession be the name of the program at the top, above teh tabs
 - MAKE SURE: to highlight that text box on hover so the user knows that it is clickable
 - Host the game on an AWS GameLift computer so the user can play the game from the browser
 - Allow the user to view the site from mobile screens and different screen sizes
 - Have a different cursor for each section of the site
 - Have a character in each section pointing out the next thing to interact with
 - Think INTERACTIVE, how can I get the user to interact with the website?
 -- Spinners, 3D objects the user can poke
 -- Little wandering creatures the user can hit with an axe cursor
 -- Little wandering creatures in a pen or cage, and the user can let them out, an then they just run around the section
 --- Maybe have castle walls to keep everything inside of their own section
 --- Have a creature with a swappable brain Linear Commands (turn right if hit wall)/state-based/random/Neural-Net
 --- A mask that shows different visuals on the page (like inverting black and white)
 --- Change colors based on mouse location (left to right) of the background
 - Have a cool loading animation (or mini-game!) for when the website initially loads
